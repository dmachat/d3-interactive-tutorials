D3 provides some convenience functions for loading data in three forms -- json, csv & tsv. As long as you give D3 a url with well-formed data, you'll be able to use it with your selectors.

*Note: Because they are text files (all strings) the csv/tsv loader functions have an optional accessor argument that you can use to do data coercion.*
