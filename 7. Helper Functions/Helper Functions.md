### Helper Functions

In addition to functions for loading external data, D3 also provides a bunch of other useful helpers for working with data.

* d3.min/d3.max
* d3.reduce
* d3.keys - lists the keys of an associative array.
* d3.merge - merges multiple arrays into one array.
* d3.nest - groups array elements hierarchically.
* d3.quantile(numbers, p)
* d3.deviation(array[, accessor]) - returns the standard deviation

As well as great time handling and formatting, and a general format function for showing pretty, annotated versions of your data.

* d3.time.format('%Y-%m-%d'); //2015-08-26
* d3.format('+,%'); //+2,400%
